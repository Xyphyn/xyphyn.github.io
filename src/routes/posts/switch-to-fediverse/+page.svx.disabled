## Quick brief

Really quick definition before everything else--when I refer to a "server" (often called instance), I'm referring to an individual website/server running the relavant software. Think email: there's a bunch of individual email "servers" run by certain people, but they can all interact. (john@gmail.com can send emails to bob@outlook.com)

# How to join...

## Lemmy

This is a decentralized Reddit alternative.

1. Go to [join-lemmy.org/instances](https://join-lemmy.org/instances)
2. Choose a server, and go to it.
   - All servers can interact with each other! You can see and create posts, comments, and communities anywhere **_no matter which server you choose._**
3. You are now on the Lemmy UI! If you want to sign up, click the "Sign Up" button on the top right.

**You're done!**

## What is this?

The _"fediverse"_ is decentralized a network of servers, typically social media servers, that can all interact and view content from each other.

It is similar to how email works. Even though they are on completely separate servers, john@gmail.com can send and view emails to and from bob@outlook.com.

An equivalent example for the fediverse would be:

- @xylight<span class="text-zinc-500">@lemdro.id</span> can see posts from @bob<span class="text-zinc-500">@lemmy.zip</span> that Bob posted to the community !casualconversation<span class="text-zinc-500">@piefed.social</span>

The typical Fediverse uses a protocol called [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/), whereas email uses SMTP.
