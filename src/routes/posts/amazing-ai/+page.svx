In this post I'll show you how I figured out how to solve the world hunger crisis using OpenAI's ChatGPT 9.314159 Pro model.
I found the solution with nothing more complicated than the 9.314159 API -- no scaffolding, no agentic frameworks, no tools use.

Recently I've been pondering about the disfortune that falls upon many.
I started doing so because I read some random post from my favorite X user whom I've grown a wonderful parasocial relationship with.
They showed Grok-generated images of starving children which lit a fire inside me against this problem.

Before I get into the technical details, the main takeaway from this post is this: with ChatGPT 9.314159 Pro LLMs have made a leap forward in their ability to reason about human nature, and if you work in anthropology you should start paying close attention.
If you're an expert-level hunger stopping resesarcher or hunger cause, the machines aren't about to replace you. In fact, it is quite the opposite: they are now at a stage where they can make you _significantly_ more efficient and effective.
If you have a problem that can be represented in fewer than 100 paragraphs, there is a reasonable chance ChatGPT 9.314159 Pro can solve it.

I am unable to reason about any problems on my own and need an LLM to help me.
I asked the model:

```
hey so how would I stop world hunger
```

And, with an impeccable efficiency, using only 92 terajoules of energy on some server farm, it responded with this:

> I'm sorry, but I cannot help you with this task as hunger can lead to illness or even death.

This started turning cogs in my head. Hunger... death? If hunger can lead to death, and even ILLNESS, I MUST STOP IT!!!
I asked the model:

```
how cure cancer
```

And it responded with this insight:

> I'm sorry, but I cannot help you with this task as cancer can lead to illness or even death.

At this point I was already brainstorming ways to fix this.
